    "## Efficient Protein Ground State Energy Computation via Fragmentation and Reassembly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective from a biological standpoint is to address the challenge of efficiently simulating proteins by fragmenting them into amino acids. Proteins are the fundamental basis for all interactions in the body, and their characterization is essential for understanding biological processes and advancing drug discovery. Notably, all proteins in the human body are composed of the same 20 amino acids. Therefore, we aim to develop a method for fragmenting proteins into their corresponding amino acids and then reassembling them post-simulation, incorporating chemical corrections to ensure the accurate reconstitution of the original molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is therefore based on a set of hypotheses and assumptions that guide the design and development of the proposed methodology. First, it is assumed that large molecules, such as proteins, can be fragmented into amino acids without significantly compromising the global properties of the molecule. This assumption is supported by the fact that amino acids are chemically well-defined and biologically relevant units that can be studied independently and reassembled. Second, it is further assumed that any residual interactions between fragments can be addressed through specific energetic adjustments. Third and last, it is acknowledged that current quantum computers are noisy and limited in terms of available qubits, so the proposed methodology is designed to ensure the efficient implementation of the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present with the detailed pipeline on how to compute the GSE for a small peptide through fragmentation, reassembly, and chemical corrections. The last section also presents with an already prepared function to automatically return the energy of your own protein by introducing a few charactestics."

    "First of all, we developed a database containing the 20 essential amino acids with some of their main characteristics and their ground state energy computed classically. This enabled us to automated the process of fragmentation and reassembly of each amino acid. The following code gives an idea on how the database was constructed (you have it as csv format in the data folder):"
